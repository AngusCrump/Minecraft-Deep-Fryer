# Minecraft Deep Fryer
 A python program to convert a folder of minecraft assets to their deep fried form.
 Pre-fried resource packs in releases page.

## Dependencies:
   - python 3
   - ffmpy (ffmpeg)
   - [deep_fried_meme](https://github.com/dinhanhx/deep_fried_meme)
 
## How it works
 The ./minecraft directory contains the default minecraft textures, sounds and files. This tool deep fries and copies the .ogg and .png files from these folders into a directory called "Deep Fried Minecraft" in the same directory structure as the original.
